This is a repository for holding projects for GDKO

## Round 1
So in this round we have to create a player character with unique abilitioes.

After brainstorming I decided to go with cat character. I found very cute pixel cat pack (https://elthen.itch.io/2d-pixel-art-cat-sprites) and started building up my project.

Say hello to Manny. It is a cat, obviously, an independent one who like to follow his own paths whenever he wants. 

More description soon...
